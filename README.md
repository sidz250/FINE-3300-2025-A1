The project is divided into two main parts:

1. Mortgage Payment Calculator (`mortgagerate.py`)  
   - Calculates mortgage payment options based on a given principal, interest rate, and amortization period.
   - Payment options include monthly, semi‑monthly, bi‑weekly, weekly, accelerated bi‑weekly, and accelerated weekly.
   - Uses the present value of annuity formula for calculations.
   - Prompts the user for required inputs and displays formatted results.

2. Exchange Rate Converter (`exchangerate.py`)  
   - Reads the latest USD/CAD exchange rate from `BankOfCanadaExchangeRates.csv`.
   - Converts amounts between USD and CAD based on user input.
   - Prompts the user for the amount, source currency, and target currency, and displays the converted amount.
